"""
Prompt Injection - demonstration (LOCAL ONLY).

This demo shows an *unsafe* pattern where user-controlled text gets concatenated into
a prompt that could be sent to an LLM. We DO NOT call any external API here.
This is only a local simulation to show why concatenation is risky and how to
structure inputs safely (e.g., via strict schemas, whitelists, or separate fields).
